## Description

 <mark>**STAMP-PICO**</mark> features an ultra-compact design with two low-power `Xtensa® 32-bit LX6 microprocessors` at `240MHz` on a PCB as tiny and delicate as a postage stamp. low power consumption.

  It is ideal for any space-constrained or battery-powered devices such as wearables, medical devices, sensors, and other `IoT` devices.

  

  \- 1, `MULTIFORM`: 5 options of installation, means endless possibilities! (SMT, DIP, flywire, grove interface), with a high-temperature resistant plastic shell, 3D antenna and components can be better protected.

  

  \- 2, `LOW-CODE DEVELOPMENT`: STAMP-PICO supports UIFlow graphical programming platform, scripting-free, cloud push; and fully compatible with Arduino, MicroPython, ESP32-IDF, and other mainstream development platforms to quickly build various applications.

  

  \- 3, `HIGH INTEGRATION`: STAMP-PICO contains 5V->3.3V DC/DC port, GPIOx12, programmable RGB light x1, button x1, finely tuned RF circuit, providing stable and reliable wireless communication.

  

  \- 4, `STRONG EXPANDABILITY`: Easy access to M5Stack's hardware and software ecology system: a wealth of sensors, actuators, functional modules, and accessories to choose from, Extremely fast adaptation.
